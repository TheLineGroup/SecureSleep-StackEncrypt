Secure Sleep Function README

Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a custom secure sleep function for Windows, designed to enhance security by encrypting stack data during the sleep duration. Utilizing advanced techniques in thread synchronization, encryption algorithms, and low-level programming, this function aims to protect sensitive data in memory from unauthorized access or modification.

Features

Custom Sleep Mechanism: Implements a sleep function that encrypts sensitive data before sleeping and decrypts it afterward, ensuring data remains secure during the sleep interval.
Advanced Encryption: Utilizes AES-128 encryption in CBC mode with PKCS7 padding to secure the data, providing a high level of security.
Low-Level System Interaction: Directly interacts with the Windows API for process and memory management, demonstrating deep system-level programming.
Thread Synchronization: Employs standard threading and timing mechanisms to manage sleep duration and ensure safe encryption/decryption operations.

Prerequisites

To compile and run this code, ensure you have the following installed:

Rust programming language environment
winapi crate for interfacing with Windows API
aes, block-modes, rand crates for encryption and random data generation
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed.
Navigate to the cloned repository's root directory in your terminal.
Run the code with cargo run.
Note: This function is designed for demonstration purposes and should be carefully reviewed and tested before using in a production environment.

Implementation Details

The function custom_sleep takes a Duration as input and performs the following steps:

Opens the current process for querying and memory operation permissions.
Allocates memory in the process's address space to simulate sensitive stack data.
Encrypts randomly generated data as a placeholder for stack data.
Writes encrypted data to the allocated memory space.
Sleeps for the specified duration using thread::sleep.
Reads and decrypts the data from memory after waking up.
Frees the allocated memory and closes the process handle.

Security Considerations

The static key and IV used in this code are for demonstration purposes. In a real application, keys and IVs should be dynamically generated and securely managed.
This implementation demonstrates a concept and should be adapted with proper security measures in place for production use.
